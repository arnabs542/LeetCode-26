# Notes:
# Starting from each element x, we go as far as the count of consecutive
# elements can go.
# We only attempt to build sequences from numbers that
# are not already part of a longer sequence, ie only if
# x-1 is not in the set.
# O(n) because we skip if x-1 is present in the set and only iterative once.
# corner example : 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
