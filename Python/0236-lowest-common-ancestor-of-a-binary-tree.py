# Notes:
# Think of a node in each call as a subtree rooted at
# that node

# If the current (sub)tree contains both p and q,
# then the function result is their LCA. If only one of them
# is in that subtree, then the result is that one of them.
# If neither are in that subtree, the result is null/None/nil.
