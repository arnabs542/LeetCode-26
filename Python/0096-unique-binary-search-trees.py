#     Notes:
#     Brute Force: Catalan number, O(4**n)
#     DP:
#     OPT[i, j] = number of BST that can be formed with element ki, ...... kj
#     where k1 < k2 < ..... < kn (sorted)
#     OPT[i, j] = sum i <= r <= j (OPT[i, r-1]*OPT[r+1, j])
#     Base Case: OPT[i,i] = 1

#     For each r as root, number of BST for [i, j] will be the product of number of
#     BST for [i, r-1] and for [r+1, j] (left and right subtrees are independent)
#     Now, total number of BST using elements from i to j will be the sum of
#     instances where root can take positions from i to j

# Notes:
# Sometimes the definition of interval can influence the algorithm performance
# If we find the relationships between intervals, they might be able to be merged
# Here is that, # of BST from [1 ~ 3] == # of BST from [2 ~ 4], and etc.
#
# Earlier we had
# dp[i][j] = # of BST can be constructed from i to j
# Now we can have
# dp[l] = # of BST can be constructed with l consecutive numbers

# To Do: using combination formula
