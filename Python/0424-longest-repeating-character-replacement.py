# Notes:
# Since we are only interested in the longest valid substring,
# our sliding windows need not shrink, even if a window may cover
# an invalid substring. We either grow the window by appending
# one char on the right, or shift the whole window to the right
# by one. And we only grow the window when the count of the new
# char exceeds the historical max count (from a previous window
# that covers a valid substring).
#
# That is, we do not need the accurate max count of the current
# window; we only care if the max count exceeds the historical
# max count; and that can only happen because of the new char.
