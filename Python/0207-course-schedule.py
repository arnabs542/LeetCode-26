# Notes:
# If there is a directed cycle, there is not topological ordering

# Unlike regular dfs which is preorder, it is postorder. Here we consider
# node visited if there are no unexplored nodes and we have to backtrack.
# Also, this is complicated to do using an iterative stack
# Notice that we say cycle only exist if being visited not is called again,
# not the visited node.
# By stack I mean virtual stack not recursion stack.

# Since we first decrement and then check if indegree == 0,
# we will never push each node twice to our queue as it will become -1
# Therefore visited array not requireds

# Whenever we pop from stack, we add that elem to our topological ordering.
# Here we are using the idea that it we are able to include all nodes in our
# ordering, we have a topological order and hence no cycle.
