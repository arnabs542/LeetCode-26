/*
Each BFS uses two sets (nextlev, phead) instead of a queue
Here, we alternatively travel from startWord and endWord.
(It is faster as we are pruning Bfs tree by avoiding choices that absolute has no
chance of leading to the final result)

Why Bidirectional Breadth First Search?
The search space considered by breadth first search algorithm depends upon the
branching factor of the nodes at each level. If branching factor remains same for
all nodes (atmost 26*word_length choices), search space increases exponentially
along with the no. of levels.
We can considerably cut down search space of the standard breadth first search
algorithm if we launch two simulatenous BFS. One from beginWord and one from
endWord. We progress one node at a time from both sides and at any point in time
if we find a common node in both the searches, we stop the search.

So bidirectional Bfs considerably cuts down the search space and
hence reduces time and space complexity.
