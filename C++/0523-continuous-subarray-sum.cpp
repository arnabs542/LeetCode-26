/*
We iterate through the input array exactly once,
keeping track of the running sum mod k of the elements in the process.

If we find that a running sum value at index j has been previously seen
before in some earlier index i in the array, then we know that the
sub-array (i,j] contains a desired sum.

running sum values can only be between 0 to k - 1 (circular fifo)
so if we are at j and the same running sum was seen at index i earlier,
subarray (i, j] contains the desired sum.

In other words, (a - (n * k)) % k is same as (a % k).
For e.g. in case of the array [23,2,6,4,7]
the running sum is [23,25,31,35,42] 
and the remainders are [5,1,1,5,0]. 
We got remainder 5 at index 0 and at index 3. 
That means, in between these two indexes we must have added a number
which is multiple of the k.
