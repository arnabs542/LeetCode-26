Brute force
Time: O(q*k), where q = number of queries

What if we remember all kth (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th.....) ancestors for each node?
Time: ctor: O(n*k^2), n = number of nodes
      getKthAncestor: O(1)
Still lead to TLE.

We need a much more efficient way to prepare and get data. When we want to get kth ancestor
of [node], if we have already known k/2th ancestor, we can use k/2th parent twice to get
the answer.

Let's remember only 2^ith parent of every node.
We can get node u's 5th parent by tracing node v's 4th parent, where node v is 1st parent
of node u.

Let up[u][i] represent node u's 2^ith ancestor. Now, when we want to get kth parent, we just turn
the number 'k' into binary and check the set bits to trace parent.

Preparing data:
for v = 0.....n - 1
up[v][0] = parent[v]
up[v][1] = up[ up[v][0] ][0]
up[v][2] = up[ up[v][1] ][1]
up[v][3] = up[ up[v][2] ][2]
....
