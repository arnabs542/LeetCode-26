/*
So, the intuition here is that, instead of forming all sorts of groups, we can check
whether each number in range [1...200,000] can be GCD for any subsequence of numbers in our
array.

In order to check if we could form some number i as GCD, we first find out all numbers that
have a factor of i in them.
Now in order for some subsequence of them to form i as GCD, it must be true that these numbers
(with factor of i in them) must all have a combined GCD of i as well.

As a subsequence can have multiple common factors, if numbers with factor of i in them form a
GCD > i, then we can never form i with any subsequence of them.
