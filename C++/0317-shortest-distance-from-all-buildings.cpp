/*
To do: Faster approach
If we don't take a fresh "visited" for each BFS. 
Instead, if we walk only onto the cells that were reachable from all previous buildings, we
can speed up.
From the first building we only walk onto cells where grid is 0, and make them -1.
From the second building we only walk onto cells where grid is -1, and we make them -2. And so on.
