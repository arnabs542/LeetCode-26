/*
* Sort cars by the start positions
* Loop on each car from the end to the beginning
* Calculate its time needed to arrive the target

cur records the current biggest time (the slowest)

If next car needs less or equal time than cur,
it can catch up this car fleet (and join with it).

If next car needs more time, it will be the new slowest car,
and becomes the new lead of a new car fleet.
