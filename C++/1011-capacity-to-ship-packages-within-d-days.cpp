/*
Intuition:
The largest capacity (r) we may even need is the sum of weights
of all packages.
The smallest capacity (l) is the weight of the largest package.
Our result is within this interval.
    Optimization: the smallest capacity cannot be less than r / D, 
    which reduces the search interval if we have a lot of small packages

Algorithm:
We use binary search to find the minimum capacity. For each capacity
we analyze, we count the number of days required to ship all packages.

We decrease the capacity if it takes less days than D, and increase
otherwise. Note that, when the number of days equals D, this algorithm
keeps decreasing the capacity while it can, therefore finding the
smallest capacity required.

range looks like this [false false true true true true]
                      [ >D    >D    =D   =D   <D   <D ]
(we want to find the index of the first true)
